// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Num = int
Sum = int
Ask for number
If Num/2= Sum
Print Even
Else 
Print Odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Num1 + Num2 +Num3 +Num 4 +Num 5)/ 5 = average
Read 5 numbers
Add the 5 numbers together and divide sum by 5
Print on the screen the average of the 5 numbers

Num1 <Num2
Set Minimum to Num1
Else
Set Minimum to Num2
Num3< Minimum
Set Minimum to Num3
Num4<Minimum
Set Minimum to Num4
Num5< Minimum
Set Minimum to Num5
Print on screen the Minimum of 5 Numbers

Num1> Num2
Set Maximum to Num1
Else 
Set Maximum to Num2
Num3 > Maximum
Set Maximum to Num3
Num4 > Maximum 
Set Maximum to Num4
Num5> Maximum
Set Maximum to Num5
Print on screen the Maximum of 5 Numbers
